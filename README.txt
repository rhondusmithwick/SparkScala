A sample of the Spark/Scala projects from my Data Engineering class.

For a project on processing real data (WhiteHouse and Wikipedia) using Spark, see
    https://github.com/rhondusmithwick/SparkScala/tree/master/src/main/scala/Programs
    
For a Spark Streaming project that runs calculations on the above programs' event logs, see
    https://github.com/rhondusmithwick/SparkScala/tree/master/src/main/scala/Streaming

For relevant terminal code, see
